## Description

This Tic Tac Toe game application is developed using Flutter. Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- Simple and Intuitive Interface: The game features an easy-to-use interface, allowing players to make their moves with a simple tap on the grid.
- Player vs. Player Mode: Play against a friend locally, taking turns on the same device.
- Player vs. Computer Mode: Challenge the computer AI with adjustable difficulty levels. Test your skills against a smart opponent.
